# Alx Higher Level Programming
This repository contains the Python projects done during my software engineering training at ALX.

## Description
The repository includes several projects that illustrate high-level programming concepts using Python. The projects range from basic Python programming, data structures, OOP, I/O, exceptions, and more.

## Project Structure
Each project is contained in its own directory, with a descriptive name indicating the concepts covered by the programs therein. The Python programs are written to conform to the pyco  Style Guide and stay true to the Zen of Python.

The directory structure is as follows:
+ .
+ ├── 0x00-python-hello_world
+ ├── 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
+ ├── 0x02-python-import_modules
+ ├── 0x03-python-data_structures
+ ├── 0x04-python-more_data_structures
+ ├── 0x05-python-exceptions
+ ├── 0x06-python-classes
+ ├── 0x07-python-test_driven_development
+ ├── 0x08-python-more_classes
+ ├── 0x09-python-everything_is_object
+ ├── 0x0A-python-inheritance
+ ├── 0x0B-python-input_output
+ ├── 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
+ ├── 0x0D-SQL_introduction
+ ├── 0x0E-SQL_more_queries
+ └── README.md

Each directory contains Python scripts related to the project, along with a README file that gives more information about the project.

## Installation and Usage
To use the scripts in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can check your Python version using the following command:

```
python3 --version
```

To execute a script, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

```
python3 script_name.py
```

## Note 
The  "#!/usr/bin/python3" in first line of all files is called shebang or hashbang.
It is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux) to indicate the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
In my files, it  specifies that the Python 3 interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3 should be used to execute the script. This way, when the script is run from the command line, the operating system knows which interpreter to use without needing to explicitly specify it.
