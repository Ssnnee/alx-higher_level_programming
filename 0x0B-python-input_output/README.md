# Python - Input/Output

# Description
This directory is dedicated to Input/Output. And we'll use Python implementation.

#### What is Input/Output ?
Input/Output, often abbreviated as I/O, is a fundamental concept in software engineering and computer science. It refers to the process of exchanging data between a computer and its external environment, which can include various devices and systems. Here's a breakdown of Input and Output:

    Input: This represents the data or information that a computer receives from external sources. Input can come from a variety of devices and sources, such as keyboards, mice, sensors, files, network connections, or user interactions. In software development, you read input to gather information or user commands that the program can then process.

    Output: Output, on the other hand, is the data or information that a computer produces and sends to external destinations. This can include displaying information on a screen, printing text on a printer, writing data to a file, sending data over a network, or any other way of conveying information to the external world. Output is typically the result of processing input data.

In programming, you often work with Input/Output operations to create interactive and functional software.
