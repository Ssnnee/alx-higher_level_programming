#  Python - Classes and Objects

### Discription 
This directory is dedicated to OOP. And it's implemented using the OOP phyton method. 
All files are OOP implementations, to help you better understand OOP.

And it's implemented in a way that follows code best practices.

## Files

+ 0-square.py  an empty class Square that defines a square

+ 1-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

+ 2-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

+ 3-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

+ 4-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

+ 5-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

+ 6-square.py a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

## Note 
The  "#!/usr/bin/python3" in first line of all files is called shebang or hashbang.
It is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux) to indicate the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
In my files, it  specifies that the Python 3 interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3 should be used to execute the script. This way, when the script is run from the command line, the operating system knows which interpreter to use without needing to explicitly specify it.
