object-oriented programming in the context of the language.

## Usage
To use the scripts in this repository, [you need to have node.js](https://nodejs.org)
installed on your machine. You can check your node version using the following
command:


```
node --version
```

For the scripts you can use the following command:
```
node script_name.js
```
Since the are all executable scripts, you can execute them using the following
command:
```
./script_name.js
```

### Note
The `#!/usr/bin/node` in the first line of all files is called shebang or
hashbang. It is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux) to
indicate the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. In my
files, it specifies that the node.js interpreter located at
`/usr/bin/node` should be used to execute the script. This way, when the
script is run from the command line, the operating system knows which
interpreter to use without needing to explicitly specify it.
